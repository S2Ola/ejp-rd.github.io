As part of the [European Joint Programme (EJP) for Rare Disease](http://www.ejprarediseases.org), we are developing standards for rare disease registries to describe their metadata that will imporve the FAIR-ness of these resources.

The core model is designed to represent data about a rare disease patient and biosample registries. The model is based on and builds on existing standards, such as the [European Rare Disease Registry Infrastructure](https://eu-rd-platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu) and the [Common Data Elements](http://www.erare.eu/sites/default/files/SetCommonData-EU%20RD%20Platform_CDS%20_final.pdf) from the rare disease community and other more generalised standards for data sharing such as the W3C [DCAT vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/). We are also working to align with similar schema standarisation efforts such as [RD connect semantic model](https://github.com/LUMC-BioSemantics/Rare-Disease-Semantic-Model), [schema.org](https://schema.org), [bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org), [MIABIS](https://github.com/MIABIS/miabis/wiki) and [GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org) (see also [schema blocks](https://schemablocks.org) and [phenopackets](http://phenopackets.org). A proposed semantic model for the Common Data Elements can be found [here](https://github.com/LUMC-BioSemantics/ERN-common-data-elements).


> Status: DRAFT - 16th July, 2019. This is currently a strawman proposal intended to generate discussion and help in developing an early demonstrator.
